# ProjectÂ 3: Interact with Big Data in Rust

## Goals
Build a functional web microservice or CLI in data engineering or machine learning engineering that uses a large data platform on AWS, it is designed to handle large volumes of data, provide scalable processing and storage, and support distributed computing. It also has built-in features for data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Functions
This project is about building a simple Calculator Microservice based on Rust that can only do four types of operation: addition, substracion, multiplication and division. The Calculator Microservice built on Rust is a great example of how powerful and flexible this programming language can be, particularly for building performant and reliable systems. Although this project is relatively simple, it lays the groundwork for more complex calculations and operations, and can serve as a starting point for building larger, more sophisticated microservices.

One of the key advantages of this microservice is its ability to handle multiple types of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By providing support for these core mathematical functions, the microservice can be used in a wide variety of applications, from simple arithmetic to more complex financial and scientific calculations.

## Prepration
1. Set virtual environment: 
* `python3 -m venv env`
* `source env/bin/activate`

2. Install rust: 
* `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
* `source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`

3. Create new project:
*  `cargo new src` (src is the project name)

## Check format and test errors:
1. Format code: `make format`

2. Test code: `make lint`

## Update main.rs and lib.rs at src
1. main.rs
* The "main.rs" file is the entry point of a Rust program. It defines the starting point of the execution of the program and serves as the root of the program's structure. In other words, the "main.rs" file is where the program begins when it is run.
* Without a "main.rs" file, a Rust program would not have a defined starting point and would not be able to run. The "main.rs" file can import code from other parts of the program, including libraries defined in other files or external crates, and use that code to perform various tasks.
* In short, the "main.rs" file is required to build a Rust program because it defines the starting point of the program's execution and serves as the root of the program's structure.

2. lib.rs
* The purpose of building a library in Rust is to create reusable, modular code that can be used in multiple projects. The library can be a collection of functions, structures, and traits that perform specific tasks, and can be easily imported and used in other parts of your project. The main file of a library in Rust is usually named "lib.rs".
* By creating a library, you can encapsulate functionality and reduce code duplication across your projects, making it easier to maintain and update your code. This also makes it easier to share code with others, as libraries can be published to crates.io, the Rust package registry, allowing others to easily integrate them into their own projects.
* In short, the "lib.rs" file is used to build a library in Rust because it provides a way to create reusable, modular code that can be used across multiple projects.

### Run the Calculator Microservice
1. Type: `cargo run` in terminal directly (my result e.g. is shown below)

2. Four main routes:

A. type: "/add/a/b" that returns a result after adding a and b

B. type: "/subtract/a/b" that returns a result after subtracting a and b

C. type: "/multiply/a/b" that returns a result after multiplying a and b

D. type: "/divide/a/b" that returns a result after dividing a and b
